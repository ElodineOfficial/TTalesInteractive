I'll update this later (tm). These are the two and only required files to run the TTI front end. More graphics and internal rerouting will be added later, for now dependant .txt's just pull from the main front end directly instead of a local option.

Anyways. Ye. That's it, bye nerds!

P.S: Yes, it's like 20k lines of spaghetti, I'm sorry for the person who tries to edit this abominaton.
